# Emotional-Situation-Test
This code is a simple artificial intelligence code that attempts to understand emotional states. Code uses OpenCV and DeepFace to perform real-time emotion recognition from a webcam feed. It starts by capturing video from the default camera and continuously processes the frames. For each frame, it attempts to analyze emotions using DeepFace's emotion detection model, which returns the dominant emotion and its confidence level. If a face is detected, the code draws a rectangle around it and overlays the detected emotion and its confidence percentage on the image. If an error occurs during the analysis, it is caught and displayed. The video feed is displayed in a window, and the program can be exited by pressing the 'q' key. Finally, the camera is released, and all windows are closed once the loop ends.
